# YOLOR-deepsort_lane_detection

YOLO processes images in a single forward pass through a neural network and directly predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for detected objects. The "ReID" in YOLOR refers to Re-identification, which means it incorporates a mechanism for person re-identification. This process is used in Lane detection which is a crucial step in various applications like autonomous driving, lane departure warning systems, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
